## Welcome to ItsmeTapi – My Data Journey Begins!
### In honor of my beloved Tapioca

I call this space "ItsmeTapi" in honor of my beloved dog Tapioca, whose loyal presence always reminded me to stay grounded and playful, even in the most complex moments.

And this is not just a blog. It’s a story of transformation, curiosity, a bit of chaos, and a lot of code. Just a few days ago, I officially dove into the deep waters of Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI through a full-time bootcamp—and what a ride it’s been so far!

### Week 1: From Zero to API Hero (Almost)

Last week, I dove head-first into the world of **Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI**—and it’s already been wild, rewarding, and exhausting!

#### Here’s what I’ve explored so far:

- **Basic Python Toolkit**: Lists, loops, and functions—my old friends now feel like power tools.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: With pandas and matplotlib, I became a data detective.
- **APIs & Web Scraping**: Fetching job listings using BeautifulSoup and `requests` made me feel like a real-world coder.

### Student Life Mode: Full-Time Everything

From morning to afternoon, it’s bootcamp mode: lectures, notebooks, and hands-on projects. Then I switch gears in the evening and wrestle with German grammar. My brain feels like a dual-core processor—running data models on one side and reflexive verbs on the other!

Yes, I’m tired. Yes, sometimes Python throws an error and I feel like throwing my laptop out the window. But I also discovered that Python can "sleep"—with `time.sleep()`—and maybe I should, too. (Seriously, sleep matters.)

### Why This Blog?

Because every error, every success, and every weird plot is worth remembering. I want to document my learning journey, my struggles, and my small wins. I hope it inspires others who are thinking of switching careers, diving into tech, or simply wondering: “Can I really do this?”

I want to share not just the *how*, but also the *feeling* of learning something from scratch.

This is my notebook, my digital garden, my tribute to Tapioca—and my way to say:

> **Yes, I can do this. And so can you.**

Stay tuned for code snippets, mini-projects, visualizations, and everything else I'm learning. Tapioca would be proud.

Stay curious, and stay tuned!
